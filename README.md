# Deleted Appointment Finder
A quick little ruby script that  goes through every file in the log/'subdirectory'  and matches the arguments for each patient ID.

## To run the program

Copy the log folder into the base directory.
Run <code>./find_patient.rb 111 222</code> replace the 111 and 222 the patient IDs you want to find.
It will return lines from the logs with the patient ids.
